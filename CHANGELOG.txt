TO DO
	- IA
		+ Evaluation of gamesate
			- 13-03-21 Identifying win-loose states
			- 14-03-21 Identifying ties
			- Identifying threats (3 in a row)
			- 30-03-21 Identifying blocks (blocking 3s and 2s in a row)
			- Control of the Zugzwang
		+ Numeric score of gamestate
			- v0.1: 30-03-21 Some cases evaluated. Added constant to score 0, 1, 2 and 3 blocks.
		+ 15-03-21 Tree: data structure
		+ v0.1: 15-03-21 Minmax algorithm
			- v0.2: 23-03-21 Minmax algorithm (now plays badly with you)
			- v0.3: 23-03-21 Now it has preference for left placement, and plays a little better
			- v0.4: 30-03-21 I don't know what I did but with depth 5 plays fine
			- v0.5: 30-03-21 Added evaluation for blocks. Hard to tell if it imporves anything
			- v0.6: 31-03-21 Now, if all children are of equal score, choose the most middle column. (Much better)  
			- v0.7: TODO when the game is lost anyway it needs to still choose the "best" play.
		+ 24-03-21 Alpha-beta pruning
		
	
DONE
	-Basic Mechanics
		+ 3-03-21 Concurrency in order to be able to interact in real time with the game
		+ 9-03-21 Error on setText (was writing an INT instead of String)
		+ 9-03-21 Detect win states
		+ 10-03-21 Better turns (IA vs player)
		+ 10-03-21 Random assignment of teams
